Last week was pretty crazy. I've been working on an iPad app with [Alex
Haefner](http://alexhaefner.com/) that we call Draw With Me and we spent
most of last week preparing to unveil it to the world. It lets people
draw together on an iPad simply and instantaneously. On Thursday, we
finally got to unveil it to the community at U of M and some Apple
employees at the first everÂ [iOS App
Showcase](http://www.eecs.umich.edu/eecs/etc/events/showevent.cgi?2045).

I think it went really well. We got lots of people excited by
theÂ possibilitiesÂ of what we've made and got some good feedback.
We're going to spend the next few days doing a last few bug fixes, move
to a more stable server, and then submit it to the App Store. Very soon
everyone will know the joy of drawing with others using Draw With Me\!
