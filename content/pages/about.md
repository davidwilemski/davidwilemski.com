Hey, I'm David\! I work as a Software Engineer at Facebook, working on
Instagram.  Previously I worked on FB's infrastructure, focusing on container
technology. I'm also an active member of [West Valley Track
Club](http://www.westvalleytc.com/).

I studied Computer Science at the University of Michigan where I grew
interested in security, distributed systems, and collaborative applications. I
had internships at [Duo Security](http://www.duosecurity.com) and Facebook
during my time in school. At Michigan, I was a founder of [Creators
Co-op](http://creatorspace.co), a live-in workspace for potential student
entrepreneurs, and was a member of [MRun](http://mrun.clubrunning.org),
Michigan's running club.
