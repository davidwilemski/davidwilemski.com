Hey, I'm David\! I'm a developer working on [Strava](https://strava.com)'s
infrastructure team.  Previously I worked on FB's infrastructure, focusing on
container technology and later on Instagram Direct. I'm also an active member
of [West Valley Track Club](http://www.westvalleytc.com/). I mostly write here
about programming and infrastructure topics as well as dumping notes from books
or papers that I read.

I studied Computer Science at the University of Michigan where I grew
interested in security, distributed systems, and collaborative applications. I
had internships at [Duo Security](http://www.duosecurity.com) and Facebook
during my time in school. At Michigan, I was a founder of [Creators
Co-op](http://creatorspace.co), a live-in workspace for potential student
entrepreneurs, and was a member of [MRun](http://mrun.clubrunning.org),
Michigan's running club.
