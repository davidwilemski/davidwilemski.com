Yesterday I ran the [Holiday
Hustle](http://holiday5k.runningfitsites.com/) in Dexter.

I'm just going to say that i think the mile markers were placed a bit
off but am pretty certain the course was still 3.1 based on a few
different measurements. Given that, I think that my mile splits were
something like this: 5:35 or maybe a little faster, 5:45ish, 5:30. I
wish I knew exactly what they were.

This course was deceptively hilly and tough. There were lots of rolling
hills and there was a pretty long hill right before mile 2 that was very
rough. I'll admit that for a little while around that 2 mile marker I
was thinking that this PR wasn't going to happen. I just kept telling
myself to stick with the people near me and not let them get to far. To
just to hang on. It Worked.

I finished at 17:12 which is 5 seconds faster than my previous best set
4 years ago\! I have been working so hard this Fall to achieve that goal
and all of the hard work and many many miles have finally paid off. It
may not be a sub-17 which was my other goal but I now know I'm well on
my way there.

I'm now done racing hard for the rest of this year. I plan on taking
about a week off entirely after this morning's long run. After that I'll
start training again for indoor and outdoor track with MRun this winter
and spring. I also signed up for the [Bayshore
Half-Marathon](http://www.bayshoremarathon.org/half-marathon) yesterday
morning (it sold out in less than 2 hours)\! This will be my first half
and the longest race I've ever done. The distance doesn't scare me too
much because I've done 12-14 mile long runs regularly but racing the
distance is a whole other deal. I've got time to train for that
thankfully.

I'm 3/3 in PRs in my last three races and that's awesome\! I'm finally
faster than high school me from four years ago\!
