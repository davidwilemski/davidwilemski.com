This morning I ran the [Firecracker
5k](http://www.a2firecracker5k.com/)Â which is my second race in two
weeks time. Going in I felt pretty tired from the mileage I\'ve been
running and not being used to that. However, my first mile was under
6:15 despite feeling like I was running well slower than 7 minute pace.
I tried evening out my pace for the second mile but pretty much blew up
before the end of that mile. I did the best I could through the rest of
the race, but ended up letting a lot of people pass me. I finished in
20:51, so not much worse than my last two races, but still not the sub
20 I\'ve been looking for. I\'m going to have to work on my race pacing
some, I\'ve forgotten what that\'s like. Full race results are
