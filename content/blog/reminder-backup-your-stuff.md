My hosting company had to fully reset my web server this week due to a
breach on their side. Thankfully, I had this blog fully backed up thanks
to the wonderful
[PressBackup](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/pressbackup/) plugin,
but it was annoying to have to set everything else back up again - and I
may have lost some other minor stuff.

It just serves as a good reminder to backup your data regularly\!
