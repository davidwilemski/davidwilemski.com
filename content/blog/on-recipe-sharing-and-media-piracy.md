This is something that's been on my mind for a while now.

Anyone that I know who has ever spent time creating a recipe in the
kitchen or that has a treasured family recipe that has been passed down
for generations is always extremely willing to pass it on so that others
may enjoy the dish. It takes a certain amount of skill and talent to
develop a good recipe as well as many hours spent perfecting it.

This is not to say that these chefs and bakers should
neverÂ receiveÂ monetaryÂ reimbursementÂ for their hard work,
however those who choose to make a living through cooking are able to in
other ways - such as building aÂ restaurantÂ around their ownÂ recipes
or even selling a book with a large collection of their recipes. Just
because they like to share a recipe for free here or there does not mean
they do not value their work. Instead I believe the willingness to share
causes others to look into the chef in question and support them more.

This is in direct conflict with what we see today in the digital media
industry. Certainly the culture of sharing recipes has been around much
longer, but today we see a push in the opposite direction. Artists are
urged to not share their work to get their name well known but instead
sign content deals with large corporations to market the work and make
profit of their own.

There are artists and film directors out there that try to succeed
through this method of sharing instead attempting to make a living off
of live shows and movie viewings. I feel that this is frowned upon
because of the industry we have built around the selling of content.

So, what do you think? Are cooks everywhere missing out? Should there be
corporations built around marketing and selling recipes or should modern
day artists rethink theÂ acceptedÂ way to gain success?

this past March. Even though I was directing this article towards
artists, it could also apply to content producers who have this same
business model.*
