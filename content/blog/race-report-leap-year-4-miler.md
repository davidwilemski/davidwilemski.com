Yesterday I ran the [leap year 4
miler](http://www.everalracemgt.com/events/full.php?2012/leap-year-4-miler.html).
It was in Willow Metro Park and was different from many of the races
that I have run in that it was in the evening. The park had no
streetlights on the course and it was quite foggy so it was actually
somewhat difficult to see towards the end of the race but overall it was
quite fun. The course was extremely flat (fast!) and the little bit of
rain didn\'t really bug me all that much.

My goal was to run under 27 minutes, which I was able to do. My splits
were quiteÂ embarrassingÂ though - just really inconsistent. I was
looking for about 6:30-6:40 pace during the race but that really isn\'t
what happened. I went out feeling pretty good and thought I was right on
pace; It turned out I ran a 6:08 for the first mile which was really
quite surprising for how little I thought I was exerting myself and the
shape I consider myself in. It turned out that was not sustainable at
all though. I tried slowing down a bit but that mile caught up with me
quickly.

The next two miles were 6:55 and 7:15 and were quite tough to keep the
pace up. There was also a bit of rain but that actually felt kind of
good. There was a turn around right before the 3 mile marker and that is
where I decided to really start pushing again. I was able to hold a
really good pace without feeling like I was about to fall apart for that
entire mile. I even had a decent kick at the end which means I probably
had more in me for the middle two miles - I just couldn\'t find it.

I finished the last mile in 6:34 for a finishing time of 26:51. Overall
sometime I\'m happy with because I beat my goal. I do think that if I
had been a bit more even in my splits that it could have been even
better but it is no use worrying about that now. Full results for the
race are

Some takeaways from this race:

-   I ran a faster 5k time than in the middle of this race than I did at
    the [Super
    5k](http://davidwilemski.com/blog/2012/02/race-report-super-5k/ "Race Report: Super 5K")
    earlier in the month
-   Â My first mile of 6:08 tells me I\'m getting some speed back but I
    know that progress will be slow
-   I need to work on pacing my miles a bit better. This is something I
    already knew that I used to have trouble with and something I
    continue to work on.

In order to help me keep a more steady pace as I train for some upcoming
races I plan on doing more mile repeat workouts. I know in the past
they\'ve really helped my pacing and improve my speed over the course of
a race.
