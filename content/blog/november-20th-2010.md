Tonight,Â  I went to the men's Glee Club performance. They did an
outstanding job and I don't think that anyone was disappointed. I
particularly enjoyed the Friars.

Afterward, I spent the evening working on my 280 project. My desk is now
a disaster - that picture will come tomorrow though. I have completed a
decent portion of it and finished the first season of Dexter. With any
luck I'll be close to done by Tuesday night so that when I get home on
Wednesday I won't have to think about it.

But, for now, sleep. Goodnight, World.
