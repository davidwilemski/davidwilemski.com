Back in mid-November I did the [Lightfest
8k](http://www.co.wayne.mi.us/events/resident/6233.htm). This wasn\'t
\*really\* a race since it wasn\'t timed and also the course was longer
than 8k, which I\'ll get to in a second. Additionally, we had trouble
finding the right place to park so we were late to the start and didn\'t
warm up.

Despite all that I decided to run fastish and see what I could do. The
first 4 miles were Between 6:05 and 6:20 but I missed most of the mile
markers so I don\'t know exactly what they were. I was okay with this -
I just enjoyed the course (it was fantastic to see the light displays)
and also kind of had fun weaving through people playing catchup to the
runners.

My last mile (yes, full mile. In an 8k.) was 5:10. It turned out that
after 4 miles I was warmed up and realized that if I ran fast I could PR
my 8k despite all the setbacks I mentioned above. It turns out the
course passed the 8k mark, had a 5 mile mark, and then finished just
past there. Based on extrapolation for 5mile-\>8k time I put myself at
30:15 which is a 50 second PR in my 8k! Win!
