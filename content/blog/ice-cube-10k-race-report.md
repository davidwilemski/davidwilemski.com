Today I drove up to and ran the Ice Cube 10k with some fellow
[a2runners](http://www.meetup.com/A2Runners/) (they actually did the
half). The highlights are that I took first overall with a time of
38:12. Also, I got a really awesome race award. It was handmade and now
I have a collection of unique race awards (including the one from [my
first
win](http://davidwilemski.com/blog/2012/10/summerfall-recap/ "Summer/Fall Recap"))\!

This is my second ever race win and my first race of the year - looks
like things are off to a great start\!
