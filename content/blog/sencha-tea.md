This week when I was
at [Sweetwaters](http://www.sweetwaterscafe.com/) (a common occurrence),
I tried some Sencha tea as it was their tea of the day. I liked it. I
looked up more information about it and apparently the taste varies
based on the temperature of water used to steep it which is really
amazing to me.

P.S. I\'ve been really busy with school but I have some running related
posts from my adventures this summer queued up to go out soon!
