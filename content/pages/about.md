Hey, I'm David\! I am currently finishing up my degree at the University
of Michigan where I study computer science before moving to the Bay Area
to work for Facebook after I graduate. I'm a co-founder of [Creators
Co-op](http://creators.coop) - a live-in workspace for potential student
entrepreneurs - and am an active member of
[MRun](http://mrun.clubrunning.org), Michigan's running club.

I have had internships at [Duo Security](http://www.duosecurity.com) and
Facebook during my time in school. I've been fortunate to work on teams
that are passionate about solving some of the biggest problems in
computer security and  scaling a site to unprecedented heights.

This blog is largely about  running but I occasionally touch on other
topics.

If you'd like to get ahold of me, the best way to do so is via email.
