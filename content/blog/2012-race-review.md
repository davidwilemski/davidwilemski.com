I wanted to take some time to reflect on my year of racing, it was
prompted by me finding the data for this tweet:

(and, yes, pun partially intended)

This is mostly going to focus on late Summer through Fall since that\'s
when I was the most dedicated and began to start reaching for goals
I\'ve had for a long time. Who doesn\'t love data?

First, let\'s look at those 18 races:

That last PR is the one I\'m most proud of both because it has been a
goal to improve my 5k since high school and because it compares most
favorably against my other PRs. (It\'s my \"best\" race)

Additionally, I ran a number of new race distances this year. I ran my
first 4 mile race - but was just getting back in shape then and that
distance is not too common. I ran my first three 10k races (and improved
on each one - arriving at a PR I\'m pleased with for the time being). I
also ran my first two 8k races, one of them being during cross country
season with MRun. Lastly, I ran a 10 miler. That race, of all of these
races, was by far the most difficult. I clearly was not prepared for a
longer distance race at the time and the soreness I had for days
afterwards reminded me of that.

I only *really* got back into training at (what I would consider) a high
level in the end of August. Noting that, I can be nothing but pleased
with what I was able to accomplish this year. Additionally, it makes me
extremely excited for what I can accomplish with a full year of quality
training during this coming year.

Now comes the part where I set goals for next year. I have 3 main goals
and an additional set of milestones that I think will happen if I\'m
able to accomplish my goals.

Goals:

1.   Race my first half marathon. Time goal: ideally sub 1:20, will be
    happy with sub 1:25
2.  Finally run a sub-17 minute 5k
3.  See what running a 100 mile week feels like

Other things I think are achievable on my way to meeting these goals:

-   Sub-36 minute 10k
-   Run over 3000 miles in a year - I think even close to 4000 is
    possible
-   (maybe) Complete a marathon

The goal that will make me happiest is the sub-17 5k but I think that
the combination of all of these things are possible on my way there. I
feel that I am finally improving as a runner again, picking up were I
left off 4 years ago. I want to see how far I can take this.
