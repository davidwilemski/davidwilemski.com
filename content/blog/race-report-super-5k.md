So. Last weekend I ran the [Super 5k](http://www.runsuperbowl.com/).
This was my first race since October and after only really running for
about a month at ~30 miles/week. Between then and now I was only running
a day or two a week for 3-4 miles - not very much.

Needless to say, this was a pretty rough race for me because I was so
out of shape. Anyhow, [I finished
in 21:44](http://www.rftiming.net/results/superbowl/superbowl_2012_5k_overall.htm)
which I guess I'll take for being so out of shape. The course wasn't
bad; it was an out and back and had a slight hill before the turn
around. The finish was not straight which is not ideal but I wasn't
exactly going all that fast...

Now a quick update on training: Since New Years I've been running with a
few groups which I'm hoping keeps me motivated to keep running the rest
of the week. This has been going well so far. I've also tentatively
begun some speed workouts. Most recently some mile repeats at around
6:45 pace. This was actually incredible difficult for me which is
extremely frustrating for me since I know that in the past I've cranked
out long runs at that pace.

That brings me to my running goals for this year:

  - Get fast again
  - Run a marathon
  - Run a sub-17 5k - this one doesn't have to be this year but I want
    to make good progress at getting to that level again.

I've been getting some good base mileage in the past month or so and
should probably come up with a more thought out training plan for at
least into late Spring.
