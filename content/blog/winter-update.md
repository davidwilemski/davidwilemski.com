It's been a while. Here's a update: I'm taking 18 credits this term and
involved in more projects and groups than ever before.

Last week we had a huge snow storm, a friend and I went out to take
photograph the storm. It was a lot of fun.

Over the weekend I participated in a hackathon and helped build an iPad
app. Everyone had really cool projects and I learned a lot. Hopefully
I'll get a video demo of the app soonish.

Lastly I joined a team that is going on a trip to the Bay area over
spring break to pitch their idea to some VCs and people from companies
like Google and Facebook. We also get a tour of their campuses and some
other cool things. I'm really looking forward to it, and, it will be the
first time I've done anything for spring break in probably forever.
