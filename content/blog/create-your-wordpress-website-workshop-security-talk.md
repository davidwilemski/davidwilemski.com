I was asked to speak at a WordPress workshop this week hosted by Lyndsay
of [MeadowFete](http://www.meadowfete.com/). I think the workshop went
really nicely but it doesn't matter what I think - it matters what the
attendes think. So hopefully they got a lot out of it.

Anyhow, I've made theÂ [slides available

Get in touch if you have questions or comments - I'm happy to help
however I can\!
