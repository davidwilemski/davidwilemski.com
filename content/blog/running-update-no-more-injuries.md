I've been running off and on again for most of the past year struggling
with injuries (pulled quad, shin splints). I think I'm close to being
able to say that that stuff is finally past me. I've been running ~20
miles a week for the past few weeks and so far so good (a few twinges in
my legs the past few days that I'm gonna keep an eye on).

night I was heading out for my run and got this crazy idea that I wanted
to do a mile time trial.Yes, despite it being the first day on new
shoes, being super wet out, and my legs acting up a little (I did say it
was a crazy idea\!). I'll be running a 5k next weekend and wanted to see
what of hard, but not all out, mile time I could get so I know how fast
to go out in this race.

So I ran a mile and a half warm up to the track. Did I mention it's
probably been a little over 2 years since I've been on a track? I
stretched a little then did my mile. It was pretty humid still despite
it being midnight but forgot about that quickly as I started. My first
lap felt easy - not too fast, not too slow - at about 1:30. The second
lap went by in another 1:30 split, but I was really feeling it by the
end of that lap. The third lap's split was 1:32 and the final lap's was
1:33 despite me feeling like I picked it up - I had forgotten how that
works. So I ended with a 6:05 mile after not training hard for months.
Something to improve on, but I'm content for now. It really surprised me
how well I actually kept my splits - that was something I always
struggled with before.

Next weekend I'm going to shoot for 6:30 pace in my 5k and see what
happens (assuming the legs are fine this week). Hopefully I'm not being
too ambitious. I'd really like to go sub 20 mins as a baseline for
getting back into racing.

I'll post something about my results next weekend after the race, and I
plan on doing more running posts to try and keep myself accountable for
my running. Sometimes the hardest part is convincing myself to get out
the door :)
