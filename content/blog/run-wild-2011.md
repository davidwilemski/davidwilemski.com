This past Sunday I ran a 5K at the Detroit Zoo. It was my first in a
while, but after training all summer I\'ve been wanting to start racing
again. The course was a loop around the outside of the zoo, most of
which was a neighborhood. It was rather flat with only one slight hill
just after the 2 mile mark.

I ended up running in 19:47 which is my best time in a while but still
no where near the speed I used to be. It was also fast enough to win my
age group. I finally broke 20 minutes - something I\'ve been trying to
do for most of the spring and summer. My splits were about 6:08, 12:35,
19:47. I really didn\'t feel like I went out too fast and actually felt
rather good the entire race. Next time I race I\'m going to try going
out at about 6:15 and hold that pace through the race to have more even
mile times.

I run the Big House Big Heart race on October 9th but hopefully will
have a chance to race once more before then. Full results for the Run
Wild race are hosted at
