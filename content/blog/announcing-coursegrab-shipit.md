hinted at a new project and I\'m ready to show off the first version:

is a little project that I\'ve been wanting to build for a while now.
The idea is simple: My university doesn\'t provide waitlists for all
classes so that students can automatically be enrolled in a class when
space opens up which means students are always checking the website for
class status.

This service will send a text message when a class you want opens up. No
more checking whether you can get into that class you want to take!
