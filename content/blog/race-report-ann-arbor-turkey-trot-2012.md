Blargh. This race didn\'t turn out to be what I had hoped. I\'m not
pleased by this but the only thing to do is put this one behind me.

Quick rundown:
==============

Mile 1: I went out with the chase pack, we hit just below 5:20 and I was
pleased with that, right on target instead of blasting the first mile
like I did last race. But the first mile is always easy.

My thoughts the rest of the race: \"Why am I getting passed? \... Just
keep going \... Ouch, why was that 2 mile so slow?\"

Mile 2 came by  in right around 11:15 or 11:20. I ran a 6 flat 2nd mile
and that right there was the race for me. The target of 11 or under
wasn\'t even close. Mile 3 was even worse. I finished in 18:23.

End of Season
=============

Since today doesn\'t qualify as a good race, I\'m now searching for a
way to fix that. I was planning on running the Lightfest 8k in Livonia
real easy just for fun this coming Tuesday night, now maybe I\'ll use it
as a tempo run and PR my 8k - should be do able since the only 8k I\'ve
run was on a cross country course that was hilly.

I thought doing easy running to maintain fitness for the next few weeks
was a good idea but now I\'m leaning the other way. 2-3 more weeks of
hard training while I get through the Detroit Turkey Trot and Holiday
Hustle seems like a good plan.
