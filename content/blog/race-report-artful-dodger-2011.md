Welp, this past weekend was the Artful Dodger 5K in St. Clair. I went
back home to run it and get another race under my belt for the summer.
My goal going in (as with the [last
race](http://oromis.davidwilemski.com/blog/206/race-report-dexter-ann-arbor-5k/ "Race Report: Dexter-Ann Arbor 5K"))
was to be under 20 mins, but I ended up with 20:16. So, faster than my
previous race but still not where I wanted to be. For the record my
splits were about 6:24, 6:44, 7:08 and I finished 15th overall (14 male,
1 female - results [here](http://speedyraces.net/11msc.html)) and 6th in
my age group. Meh.

The 4th of July will be the Firecracker 5K here in Ann Arbor, I'm REALLY
hoping I can finally go sub 20.
