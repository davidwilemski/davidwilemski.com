Today, [Daring Fireball posted a
link](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/09/22/fox-market)to Kevin
Fox's analysis of how to fix the android Marketplace.

I disagree with both of them. I don't believe the launcher needs to be
killed. Let's face it, a phone is no longer just a phone. It does 80% of
the tasks that I used to do on a computer.

While using my mac I do not have a desktop (analogous to the home
screen) shortcut to every single application that is installed. I have a
few shortcuts on my desktop and dock and then use a 'launcher' to
execute anything else that I might need.

Having every icon on my 'home screen' makes the same amount of sense on
my phone as it does on my computer.

Now that being said, I do like Fox's analysis of what Apple does to get
users to open the app store and Android handset designers could learn
from that.
