Today was yet another rainy day here and so I thought that this
wouldn\'t turn out so well. Surprisingly, the color details are pretty
darn good - perhaps I should have stopped for a bit longer to improve
the focus.

These gigantic leaves really caught my eye today, even while rushing
through the rain. Also, the contrast between the giant green leaves and
tiny colorful flowers is just great. I must go by here a good few times
per week, so just think about what else I could be missing!

EDIT: my phone didn\'t publish this yesterday when I asked it to. Oops!
Sorry.
