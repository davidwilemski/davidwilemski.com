I spent most of this weekend camping up in Traverse City with a group of
friends. We were there for the [Bayshore
races](http://www.bayshoremarathon.org/). Most of the people I was with
had spent months preparing for their race this weekend - and I was sort
of a last minute addition. Everyone had an awesome race and PR'd.

I was there to run the 10k and going in I honestly wasn't very confident
because I've pretty much been in some state of injured since my [last
race](http://davidwilemski.com/blog/2012/04/race-report-martian-10k-2012/ "Race Report: Martian 10K 2012").
I took about 10 days off towards the beginning of May and had only been
running again for about 2 weeks when we got up there and most of the
running since Martian has been pretty easy miles, nothing hard.
Additionally the only speedwork I've done was crammed into the past 2
weeks with the group and neither workouts went amazingly well.

My plan going into the race was to run 7 min pace for the first 5k and
then see how I was feeling and maybe pick it up for the second 5k. My
thinking was that if I had any chance of running a good race I would
need to push hard in the second half. Things didn't go quite as planned
- but that's not a bad thing\!

The first mile I went out focusing on running easy and keeping a smooth
pace. I ended up going through the mile marker in 6:22. Needless to say
that was a bit of a surprise. I'm used to going out fast but I made an
extra effort to go out easy. I focused on slowing down the next few
miles. Miles 2 and 3 were at 6:45 and 6:58 respectively.

Somewhere in between mile 3 and 4 I just sort of zoned out and cruised -
that ended in a mile pace of 7:19. It was definitely a bit slow but I
didn't end up too worried because I knew I was still averaging under 7
minute pace because of the fast first 2 miles. The 5th mile I focused on
getting back in stride - 7 flat.

For all of mile 6 I focused on going as fast as possible, to really push
it. I kept telling myself I just had a mile left. I was reeling some
people in and that helped me stay on pace.

I finished in 42:06 which was a pretty good PR over Martian. I was
extremely surprised because like I said, I feel I was way more prepared
for that race than this one. I somehow kept everything together and had
a solid race here. It definitely excites me that I'm improving. [Full

## The Plan

I'm completely focused on getting fast again at this point. I'll do
anything I can to get closer to that goal. The first step in that
process is to take two weeks off in an attempt to shake off Â the
nagging injuries in my foot. I'll reevaluate at that point but as long
as everything goes well I'll start building a nice base. I want to take
things nice and slow and not build up too quickly and end up with
injuries like this cycle.

The end goal is to start racing again in the Fall and hopefully start on
the long road to a 5k PR.
