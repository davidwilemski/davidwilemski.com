Today I went to a tech talk given by Google about Chrome as a Google
product and a large scale open source project. It was really interesting
to get some insight into how Google works and to hear about all the
different things that go into Chrome.

Plus, I got this awesome Google t-shirt and a pretty cool bag. Free
stuff is always nice.
