Well, last weekend was the race I talked about in my last post. There
were way more people there than I thought there would be.

Parking ended up being a nightmare so I didn't have time to warm up
before the race. This meant I took the first mile easier than I wanted
to minimize injury risk and ran the next two at a hard pace instead of
at full race pace. The first was still possibly my fastest mile because
there was a bunch of down hill running. The next two miles I ran with a
steady pace (I think, I don't have splits). I ended up running 20:45;
so, slightly slower than I wanted to but something I can be pleased with
with the small amount of training I've been doing. Overall, I loved the
course. It had the right mix of hills and flat running, I'll definitely
be doing this one again - but maybe a longer distance next year? We
shall see.

I took this past week pretty easy, only a few hard runs and nothing over
4 miles. Monday I'm looking at starting the PPM program up again; which
was something I haven't done since high school. I'm going to start at 30
miles a week and see how that goes, maybe I'll move up to 40 after this
week but more than likely I'll stick with 30 for a few more just to be
safe. I really don't want any more injuries.
