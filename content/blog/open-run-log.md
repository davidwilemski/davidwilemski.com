Since getting some extra time over winter break I was able to dig up a
project from earlier this year. I've posted a few previews of my
progress on Twitter over the past few days - but today I'm ready to open
up the site for others to test and use.

[Open Run Log](http://openrunlog.org) is a website that I built to use
as a training log. I've built in some auto-generated graphs and have
ideas for other things in the future like goal setting and tracking,
public profile pages and sharing, custom graphs, or other fun things. It
is at a point where I felt comfortable switching to it for tracking my
runs and so today I imported my old training log into the site so that I
didn't lose that data. It is only going to improve from here on out and
I'm very excited by the possibilities\! (Yes, I'm a data nerd when it
comes to my running
log.)

So why not use one of the many other run tracking websites? Because I
didn't want to miss the chance to mix my two passions (running and
coding). Also I was excited about all the different ways in which I
could analyze run data in the future so having control over the code and
data was important to me - and I wanted to give that freedom to others
as well which is why [I made the source code
available](https://github.com/davidwilemski/openrunlog). I think that
projects like [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) and
[ThinkUp](http://thinkupapp.com/) provide great software and have a
great model of making both the software and code available to anyone
interested and I wanted to do the same.

If you give it a try, be sure to let me know what you think\!
