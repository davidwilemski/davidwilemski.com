As I\'ve had this blog setup for a few months now and have just a few
posts I\'m setting some new goals for me to stick with. I don\'t wish to
commit too much time here as I have lots of exciting other things that
are grabbing my attention - these you will hear about soon enough. There
are also lots of other things that need my attention which are not as
exciting - such as keeping up with my classwork.

\"So\", you might ask, \"what can I expect to see here?\"

Starting tomorrow, I plan on taking one photo per day and posting it
here. This photo will be taken with a camera and will not be a
screenshot of any type. Furthermore, I will also be writing at least one
post a week. It may be more but I am going to stick to at least the one.
I am not committing to a day as of yet but if need be I will - and that
would be announced here of course. These posts will be about the
projects I am working on and any observations I make through out the
days that I may want to record for the future. Lastly, as time permits,
I will be working on a custom theme for this blog that will closely
resemble that of [DavidWilemski.com](http://davidwilemski.com/). I just
have to populate that site with my own projects first.

Be on the look out for my photo of the day and first weekly post! If you
were feeling really generous you could even subscribe to my feed\...
