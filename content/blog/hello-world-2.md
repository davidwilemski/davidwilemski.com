I\'m starting this blog to record my thoughts on various topics.

As I am a Computer Science student and have been doing lots of web and
mobile development as of late, many of my posts will focus on my
experiences with web development, Android development, and the
occasional news item as I see fit. However, I am not claiming this is a
tech or development blog and as such I may also write about other
topics.
