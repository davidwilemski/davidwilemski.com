Earlier this week I was getting a lot of pain in the top of my foot when
I was running from what felt like the shoe laces digging into my foot. I
don\'t believe that I\'ve been tying my shoes differently but I was
unable to adjust my shoe in any way to stop the pain. I\'ve tied my
shoes the same way for as long as I\'ve been running and never had an
issue.

I decided to try tying my shoes like a \'normal\' shoe - without the top
corners laced - over the past few runs and things seem to be better. I
find it really interesting that this could make such a difference and
it\'s something I\'ll definitely keep an eye on.

These
[Nike](http://davidwilemski.com/blog/2011/05/running-update-no-more-injuries/ "Running Update: No more injuries")
shoes (same shoe, different pair) have given me more problems than any
shoe before. I\'ll definitely be going back to good o\'l Asics for the
next pair.
