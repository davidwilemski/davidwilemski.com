Today I was messing around with various options on my camera. I\'m
pretty happy with this shot - It definitely encapsulates two things that
are pretty important to me as a college student. I\'ve been thinking
about getting a DSLR and maybe I will - but probably not till about
Christmas. I know, given some practice, I could make a much better shot
with a better camera. For now I\'m extremely happy with my phone\'s 8MP
camera (what I\'ve been using for all of my shots thus far and into the
foreseeable
future)[![](http://oromis.davidwilemski.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/IMG_20101003_140240-300x225.jpg "IMG_20101003_140240"){.size-medium

- as good as any point and shoot but one less device to carry.
