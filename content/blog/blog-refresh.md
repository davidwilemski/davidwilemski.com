A brief update on a seemingly defunct blog: Over the weekend I finished up the
first iteration of porting my blog from WordPress over to a static site
generator. For now I'm using [Pelican](http://getpelican.com) and the [Blue
Penguin](https://github.com/jody-frankowski/blue-penguin) theme. I wanted to
move to a static site generator in the hopes to simplify the hosting and
writing processes to incentivize myself to write a bit more. I selected Pelican
because it had an importer from WordPress and seems to work well enough for
now.

The first new post I hope to get up some time in the next week will be about
what I'm learning in the process of getting getting up to speed in a new
codebase.
