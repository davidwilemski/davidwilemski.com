Last Thursday on Thanksgiving I raced a 10k at the Detroit Turkey Trot.
This was a big day for me because it was my first 10k encounter since
[Bayshore](http://davidwilemski.com/blog/2012/05/bayshore-10k-2012-race-report/ "Bayshore 10k 2012 Race Report")
in the summer. I knew I had a chance for a major PR because I am in much
better shape now that I was then.

Going into the race, my goal was to hit 6 minute pace for as long as
possible and then just see if I could go faster for the last mile or so.
It turns out most of that worked out. I missed all of the mile markers
until mile 5 so for most of the race I had no idea how fast I was going
but was just focusing on keeping things fast but smooth and not pushing
too hard. After the 1st mile or so where I had moved up though the pack
I found a group doing about my pace and just sort of tucked in. I
crossed the 5 mile mark at 29:55 and was extremely happy to see that
everything was going according to plan.

The last 1.2 was a bit rough it turns out but I still finished in 37:34
which is a huge PR of almost four and a half minutes! Awesome.

Then it was time to go chow down on some delicious Thanksgiving day
food. The Turkey Trot was a great start to the day though, even if I did
have to wake up at 4:30am.
