I've been somewhat preparing for the [Bayshore
marathon](http://www.bayshoremarathon.org/) through the winter and into
the spring. Realistically, my workouts have been more suited for 5k to
half-marathon training but since I was coming off of injury, I think any
workouts were better than no workouts.

As a result, I've had to scale back my goal expectations. Various
calculators like the Daniels VDot and McMillan estimate I should be able
to run under 2:50 even off of some of my more average 5k and 10k times,
and something like 2:55 based off of last year's Bayshore half time. I
know I haven't done equivalent marathon training to last year's 5k and
half marathon training so I'm hoping that I can run sub-3:05 to qualify
for Boston, and would like to run 2:59 or so. I tell myself that if I
qualify for Boston, that will be my first marathon on a 'real' training
cycle.

I'm still not sure sub-3 is realistic. My long runs haven't been long
enough or frequent enough and I haven't done enough marathon pace work
or tempo runs. My [longest run was 16
miles](https://openrunlog.org/u/david/run/536e7410d1ec593175b27d27) this
past weekend. Tomorrow, I'll do my last tempo run of 5-6 miles, probably
around half marathon pace or just under it. After that there is nothing
left to do. We'll just have to find out what happens.

I could take the easy route out and just run this thing for fun but I've
already done that for too many races this year. My fitness and weekly
mileage may not be where I think they should be but that isn't an excuse
to shy away from running what I'm capable of for where I'm at now.

I'm going to shoot for a sub 3 hour time anyway, it could be a
hilariously bad experience or it could go really well. If I don't try,
I'll never know.
