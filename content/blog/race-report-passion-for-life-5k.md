The other week I sort of decided to run this 5k at the last minute. The
course was almost entirely flat and overall organized pretty well. The
downside was that I didn't improve on my recent 5k times at all - I
guess things weren't as smooth as I thought last post. Anyhow, I
finished with a 20:54 which somehow got me the age group win as well. I
was actually very disappointed with my time and really felt like I
shouldn't have won the age group either - especially since the course
was so flat. Full results can be found

Since then it has been training as usual. Last Friday I actually ran the
first hard track workout that I've done in a while with some friends. We
did 4x5:00 hard with 3:00 rest in between and then 3x200m hard as well.
This workout was actually very encouraging for me since all of my laps
on the track were very even and I was right on pace for 6 min miles all
the way though. So maybe in the past that would have been nothing for
me, for now I'll take it\!

I was very sore over the weekend following that workout (I forgot how
much speedwork hurts\!) but managed to get over it by Monday and then
yesterday I was able to run a 12 mile long run which turned out to be
right at 8 min pace average. This was another hugely comforting workout
and it turned out today I felt pretty good on my [group
run](http://www.meetup.com/A2Runners/events/58450522/).

I'm getting excited for the Martian 10K - it's just about a week and a
half away\!
