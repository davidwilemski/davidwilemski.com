"UMich Dining Menu")](http://oromis.davidwilemski.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Screen-shot-2010-07-22-at-9.34.23-PM.png)I've
been interested in Android development for some time now. However, I
never actually got around to setting up the development environment -
until now. Before I give my impressions on the documentation that covers
how to do all of this, I'd like to clarify that I'm not new to the
development world at all - I've had a good few years experience - mostly
with C++ and PHP and a few programming courses by now as well. I have
not, however, had any experience with Java up until now. These are my
immediate thoughts about developing on Android after spending some time
(only a few hours so far, maybe 5 or 6) getting familiar with the SDK.

So far, I've been very pleased with how well the documentation is
written. I followed the [setup guide at the Android Developers
website](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing.html). My first
step was to download and install
[Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) for my platform. I'm
running Mac OS, and that's the platform that my Android development
experience has been on thus far. After getting Eclipse set up I then
proceded to follow the instructions to get the latest (2.2 as of this
writing) [Android SDK](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html) and
setup the SDK tools.

I also took the time to setup a virtual Android device (AVD) and test it
for a few minutes (not as fast as my [HTC
Incredible](http://www.htc.com/us/products/droid-incredible-verizon#tech-specs)\!)
Even though I did this here, the next guide walks you through the steps.
I found them quite selfÂ explanatoryÂ and took the liberty to do it on
my own.

Once finished setting up my development environment I dove right into
the [Hello,
Android](http://developer.android.com/guide/tutorials/hello-world.html)
demo application. This tutorial shows how a very minimalistic is built
and what components it needs. As with the previous tutorial, this one
was written very well with a good mix of beginner tips and intermediate
developer centric portions. There were few, if any, portions of the
guide that left me lost or feeling unsure of what to do next. In
addition, I felt comfortable exploring [SDK
documentation](http://developer.android.com/reference/packages.html)
immediately after completing the Hello, Android program and started
messing with other Views and Actions available from the SDK.

Whenever I got stuck or wasn't exactly sure of how to do something (keep
in mind that at this point I've only been using the SDK and Java for an
hour or two now) theÂ excellentÂ [Hello,
Views](http://developer.android.com/resources/tutorials/views/index.html)
tutorials helped set me on the right path.

After only reading those three tutorials and a few documentation pages I
felt ready to begin work on my own application. What I have so far is an
application that has two layers of tabbed menus with scrollable lists in
each section. That's all I can show you for now - more on that in a
later
post.

I'm extremely impressed with how easy it is to develop Android
applications so far. It really is quite easy to go from not knowing a
thing about Android programming to being ready to build your own
application all within a single afternoon or maybe a couple of nights.
I'm super excited to continue working on my application and hope that
this article helps to alleviate any fears that others may have about
getting started with Android development.
