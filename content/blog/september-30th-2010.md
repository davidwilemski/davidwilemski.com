Today, I came up with a great idea forÂ my personal website. I just had
to draw it out though because otherwise I would never have stopped
thinking about it until I built it. It got me thinking about just how
thin I've been spreading myself. Between work and school and personal
projects like mschedule and my Android development, I just don't have
time for all of it. Especially when I consider all of the things I'd
like to do with other people as well.

My solution? After I catch up to my current backlog, I am going to
reorganize my priorities. Whether this uses the GTD method or something
else, I need to better use my time.

Now my photo of the day: my awful sketch of how I'd like my new site to
look.
